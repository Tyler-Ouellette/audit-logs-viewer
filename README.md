# DISCLAIMER
This project was created by myself, an SE of Dynatrace. This is not an official Dynatrace application and it is not something you can open a support ticket on. You may create an issue on the github repository, however there is no guaruntee it will be addressed (this isn't my primary job, just a fun project). 

# Prerequisites

Install the Dynatarce dt-app toolkit:
```
npx dt-app@latest
```

Users looking to access the application will need the following scopes to be able to access all the pages of the application:
```
  storage:logs:read
  storage:buckets:read
  storage:system:read
  environment-api:audit-logs:read
  environment:roles:manage-settings

  The user must also have:
  app-engine:apps:run
  app-engine:functions:run
```

```
    "scopes": [
      {
        "name": "storage:logs:read",
        "comment": "Access Logs"
      },
      {
        "name": "storage:buckets:read",
        "comment": "Access Buckets"
      },
      {
        "name": "storage:system:read",
        "comment": "Read System Tables for Audit Logs"
      },
      {
        "name": "environment-api:audit-logs:read",
        "comment": "Read old Audit Logs from API"
      },
      {
        "name": "environment:roles:manage-settings",
        "comment": "Manage Settings are required to view old audit logs"
      }
    ]
```
